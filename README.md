# Project-Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple web application that allows users to create a grid of squares and paint them dynamically based on mouse movements.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Users can specify the number of squares per row and column to create a grid.
- **Interactive Painting:** Each square changes color dynamically based on mouse movements within the square.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Styles the grid and squares.
- **JavaScript:** Handles grid creation, square painting logic, and user interactions.

## Usage:
1. **Setup:**

     cd Project-Etch-a-Sketch
     ```

2. **Run Locally:**

3. **Grid Creation:**
   - On page load, a default grid of 16x16 squares is created.
   - Click the button to change the grid size. Enter a new number of squares per row/column (between 1 and 100) in the prompt that appears.
